## Title

Land of the Fallen Magi

## Premise

<p>
	In the world of Elison, magic power doesn't disappear when a wielder dies. Rather, it merges with the land where they are laid to rest. This usually results in benefits to the surrounding area, such as the tomb of a lightning mage acting as a lightning rod for a town during storms or the tomb of a plant mage granting fertile soil.
</p>
<p>
	However, recent events have shown these tombs to also have the potential to cause great problems. The warmth provided by a fire mage's tomb became too intense and the town caught fire. The mines rich in minerals and ore for another town have become too dangerous for workers because of constant earthquakes coming from the tomb of an earth mage.</p>
<p>
	To combat the growing number of catastrophies, a new group has been formed called the Magic Justiciars. Their job is to go into these problematic tombs and deal with whatever is causing the magic power to run rampant.
</p>

## Overview

### Game Start

<p>
	The player will start by selecting a weapon and an element of magic to be used by their magic justiciar.
</p>

#### Starter Weapons

- Sword
- Bow
- Staff

#### Starter Elements

- Fire: Ember Shot
- Ice: Ice Imbuement
- Lightning: Flash Step

### Core Game Loop

<p>
	After creating their character, the player will select one of three missions. Each mission will have the name and element of the fallen magic wielder as well as their most prominent characteristic, such as mischievous or generous. How these characteristics affect gameplay will be described in the level generation section.
</p>
<p>
	Defeating the magic wielder at the end of a dungeon will allow the player to add or replace a skill, up to a maximum of four skills. The player will also gain experience and levels through combat to make their character more resilient and effective.
</p>
<p>
	Upon completion of a mission, the player will be given another three choices for their next mission. Missions will go up in difficulty after each completion, and will continue to do so until the player dies.
</p>

### Level Generation

#### Elements

<p>
	The element of a tomb's magic wielder will determine the overall color scheme. Lightning will have hues of yellow and white. Fire will have a combination of orange and red.
</p>
<p>
	The element will also determine what strengths and weaknesses the enemies in the tomb will have. Basically, using fire spells in a water mage's tomb is going to be a rough time.
</p>

#### Mage Characteristics

<p>
	The characteristic of the magic wielder will determine either the shape or cause special areas to exist in a dungeon. Some examples below:
</p>

- Generous
    - Increased number of enemies, chests, and drops (Make it rain blood and gold)
- Puzzle Master
	- Some sort of puzzle will be required to reach the magic wielder
- Secretive
	- One or more keys will need to be recovered to unlock the room of the magic wielder
